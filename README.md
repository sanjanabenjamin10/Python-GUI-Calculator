# Python-GUI-Calculator

# Creating the calculator's layout
A frame is utilised to create the screen, and two labels, one for digit buttons and the other for function keys, are employed in this calculator. To add buttons, I used sub-labels within these labels.


# Creating a screen

The calculator's interface is created using an entry box.



# Bringing the buttons to life

My claculator was virtually unusable up until this point. I tried tying buttons to functions, but the results were shown on the console rather than on the calculator's screen, so I tried putting lambda in the buttons, which worked!

# Giving the calculator a Midas touch
I put this code in the class calculator's init function and gave it some lovely colour combinations to make it seem nicer, and here it is!
